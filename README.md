This is the source code for a windows basd software tool which was created between 2000 and 2002. It was created as 
part of an educational tool to help people learn to speed read.   This enterprise was abandoned following the exit 
of my business partner.  What remains is a productivity tool that processes text in place and renders it to a user 
rapidly from within a number of host applications (Mircorosft Word and Internet Explorer being the principal ones.

It uses a COM component to process and render the text and that is the principal value within the application. 

It is written in C++, and uses mfc, COM and ATL. There is also a host application written in Visual Basic.
