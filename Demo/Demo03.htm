      <P>From the WinBlit&nbsp;Window you will be able to read the text of the 
      document using a speed reading&nbsp;technique&nbsp;known as Rapid Serial 
      Visual Presentation (RSVP). The basic idea of RSVP is to bring the text to 
      your eyes rather than in traditional reading where your eyes move to text. 
      Some people like RSVP because it helps them to read more quickly and 
      others because they find it a more comfortable way to read. We hope it 
      serves as an assistant to those of you bogged down in your working life 
      with information overload on your PC.</P>
      <P>For an example of what RSVP appears like click the button with 
      the&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG height=15 
      alt="" src="play.bmp" width=17>&nbsp;icon on the toolbar 
      below.</P>
<P>Yes it is that simple. Text from whichever 
      document are reading just gets flashed before your eyes. Though it may 
      feel an unnatural way of reading at first with practise you may find that you can 
      read more rapidly and that your comprehension will improve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></TD></TR></TABLE></P>
