      <P>Now we will discuss the 3 main ways in which&nbsp;a user can operate 
      WinBlit when speed reading. </P>
      <P>1<STRONG>) Toolbar </STRONG>- 
      As discussed each toolbar button corresponds to a different operation you 
      can perform on WinBlit (we have already tried <IMG height=15 alt="" 
      src="play.bmp" width=17>      
          ). To get an idea of&nbsp;what&nbsp;each button does move 
      the mouse over each button in the window below.&nbsp;You should see&nbsp;some&nbsp;tooltips&nbsp;displayed&nbsp; 
      to you&nbsp;giving you a clue to the operation- we will discuss&nbsp;each of these shortly. 
      </P>
      <P><STRONG>2) Context menu - </STRONG>   Click the right button of the mouse anywhere 
      in the WinBlit Text window. You will see a context menu displayed. 
      Each word on the context menu when selected 
      corresponds to a different operation you can carry 
      out on WinBlit.</P>
      <P><STRONG>3) Shortcut keys - </STRONG>The&nbsp;third way&nbsp; of 
      operating WinBlit is by shortcut keys. They are also the recommended way 
      of operating WinBlit once you become accustomed to it as for example it is 
      much easier to just hit the spacebar to start speed reading than to click 
      a toolbar button with the mouse or select an entry from the context menu. 
      </P>
      <P>Shortcut&nbsp;keys are available whenever the WinBlit text window is in 
      focus. To put&nbsp;the WinBlit&nbsp;Window in&nbsp;focus and make these 
      shortcut keys available simply&nbsp;left mouse-click anywhere inside the 
      Text Window.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P></TD></TR></TABLE>
