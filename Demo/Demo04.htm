<P>          
                   
           Now lets have a 
      closer look at the WinBlit&nbsp;Window in the frame below.          
             
           
      </P>
      <P>The Window is divided into 4 areas , from top to bottom these are the 
      Toolbar , the Text Window, the Trackbar&nbsp;and the status bar at the 
      bottom.</P>
      <P><STRONG>ToolBar -</STRONG>          Each icon on the toolbar represents a unique function 
      (you have already tried the "play" function). The toolbar 
      is the first of 3 possible ways you can operate WinBlit. </P>
      <P><STRONG>Text Window&nbsp; -&nbsp;</STRONG>          
                  This 
      is of course where&nbsp;the text is flashed to you in the manner you have 
      chosen. As you will see later you have an 
      enormous amount of control over how&nbsp;text appears and how it is flashed 
      to you. . </P>
      <P>
      <TABLE style="WIDTH: 580px; HEIGHT: 92px" borderColor=#ffff99 
      cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 width=580 align=center border=1>
        
        <TR>
          <TD>
            <P><STRONG>Trackbar - </STRONG>Beneath the text window you can see 
            the trackbar which moves left to right as your reading 
            progresses&nbsp;through a document. You can change your place in a 
            document by clicking on the trackbar cursor and dragging it to the 
            left or to the right. </P>
            <P><STRONG>Statusbar - </STRONG>At the bottom of the Window you can 
            see the status bar. When you are&nbsp;reading with WinBlit 
            this&nbsp;displays some basic statistics on your reading speed.
