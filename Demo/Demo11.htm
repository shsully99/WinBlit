      <P>We would like to mention a&nbsp;few &nbsp;features our users have found 
      particularly helpful before taking our leave. </P>
      <P>1<STRONG>)&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fast forward and 
      reverse".&nbsp; </STRONG>     Set the current 
      Configuration of WinBlit to "RSVP Sample2". This configuration's settings 
      mean that a fixation is the whole screen width. Click anywhere in the 
      WinBlit Window and hit the down arrow key. You can rapidly scan through 
      the document pacing your speed reading manually. You can fast reverse of 
      course by using the up arrow. </P>
      <P>2<STRONG>)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Metafile".</STRONG> From the context menu select "Show Metafile". As you 
      can&nbsp;see you can toggle&nbsp;whether this graphic representation&nbsp;of the&nbsp;current 
      page of text appears or not.</P>
      <P><STRONG>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;"Breakpoints".</STRONG> Breakpoints (which you can find on the 
      Settings dialog) allow further fine tuning of your speed reading by 
      allowing you pause or delay your speed reading at key words in the document 
      or at punctuation marks.
      </P>
