<P>There are many settings you can vary in WinBlit - 
      Text Size, Fonts, Colours and speed and Fixation size (i.e. the amount of text 
      that is flashed to you at any one time) are the most 
      important. These are of course all customisable to suit your own 
      requirements.</P>
      <P>To view or change the current settings of WinBlit 
      either click the <IMG height=15 
      alt="" src="settings.bmp" width=18> 
      &nbsp;icon on the toolbar&nbsp;OR select <STRONG>Settings</STRONG>    from 
      the context menu&nbsp;OR use the <STRONG>"E"</STRONG> shortcut key. </P>
      <P>        
                
       The first tab is called Configuration and will be 
      discussed shortly.&nbsp;Have a look at the other&nbsp;tabs on the dialog 
      and experiment with them. You can find out exactly what all of the 
      Settings do by looking at the help file in more detail but more 
      importantly you can watch the effect of changing anything in the Settings 
      by the Preview screen at the bottom. To see how a change in the Settings 
      affects speed reading you can always click the&nbsp;<IMG height=15 
      alt="" src="play.bmp" width=17> button that appears to the top right of the Preview 
      screen on any of the tabs.<STRONG> </STRONG>Our users 
      often find that it only takes a minor change in&nbsp;Settings to "suddenly 
      feel comfortable" using WinBlit. The Settings dialog box is a good place 
      to experiment with different Settings until you get there.
