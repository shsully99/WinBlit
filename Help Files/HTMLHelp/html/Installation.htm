<P>Download the self-extracting archive WinBlit32.exe. This 
is available on various portals on the World Wide Web including <A 
href="http://www.winblit.com">www.winblit.com</A>      
           . It is recommended that you log in to your PC into an account which has Administrator privilege. </P>

<P>Before starting installation make sure that you have closed down Outlook, Internet Explorer and Word. If you have a previous version installed, you are prompted to uninstall it. Press ‘OK’ to continue with the installation. Press ‘Cancel’ if you want to exit the installation program without installing the software. The installation program may ask you to restart your machine to finish the installation correctly. </P>

<P>The installation program creates a directory for WinBlit, copies all of the files to that directory and creates a Program Group called WinBlit which is available if you click the start button and select Program Files. </P>

<P>WinBlit should now be available from all of its containers. See <A href="UsingWinBlitOverview.htm">Using WinBlit</A>.</P>

<P></P>

<P>Note: -</P>

<P>If you are using Microsoft Word with WinBlit you will need to perform one additional step when logged into any account other than the one used to install WinBlit. You will need to copy the Word template WinBlitTemplate.dot to the Microsoft Word startup folder from the folder where WinBlit was installed. </P>
