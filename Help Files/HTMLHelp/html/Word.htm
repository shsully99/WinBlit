<P>When you open Word you will see the WinBlit logo on the toolbar. Click this button to start WinBlit. </P>

<P>     Alternatively - select ‘WinBlit’ from the Tools menu. You can then read the text of the currently open&nbsp;document from within the WinBlit Window. </P>
<P><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG>If you would like to read just a portion of the text of the word document 
then you can select it with the mouse (as you usually do when selecting text in 
a word processor). Start up WinBlit (via the toolbar or the menu) to just bring 
the selected text into the WinBlit window. </P>

<P>Note – you cannot currently resize the WinBlit screen once it is open. It automatically assumes the size of the Window of Word. To resize it you must therefore close the WinBlit Window, resize the Word Window and start WinBlit again.</P>
